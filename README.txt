DESCRIPTION:
	This project is about the simulation of some well-known data structures. I have laid more stress on visualising these data strucutres and the operations on them through animation rather than handle them like how we have done in the course. I have extensively used the commands of the ncurses library. So the features of my project are the usage of known data structures and the use of a new library.
	Stacks have actually been drawn using a stack i.e elements printed in the stack have actually been popped from the stack. Queue makes a partial implementation of queue data structure. Although I have simulated lists, it is not with the help of the list data structure.
